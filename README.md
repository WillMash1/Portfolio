# Portfolio
The Portfolio showcases three projects which showcase my current abilities. 

## VGNetflix
This project utilises an api to gather images and information about videogames. It uses a search bar so you can search for any game you want and information will appear about it.
It also uses carousels to show games from different categories. The dropdown next to the row title allows you to change the category and make a new call to the api for a new 
list of games. Click on one of the games to see information about the game displayed. 

## Memory Game
This is a memory game I created with javascript. It includes increasing levels of difficulty. To win you need to memorise the order of the numbers on screen and then 
press them in the right order. 


## Restaurant Website
This is a website designed for a fake restaurant business. The website includes css to create an attractive design, but also uses javascript to create various animations
and effects to improve user experience.
